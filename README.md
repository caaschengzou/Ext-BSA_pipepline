# Extended-BSA (Ext-BSA), a pipeline for bulked sample analysis (BSA)
## Overall
We present a novel statistical method called **Extended-BSA (Ext-BSA)** that takes advantage of high-density genetic markers generated by the next generation sequencing (NGS) of bulked samples to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
## Detail
After massive simulations, we used Ext-BSA to detect QTLs related to turicicum leaf blight (TLB) in a natural maize population and QTLs related to gray leaf spot (GLS) in a maize F<sub>2</sub> population. The newly reported QTLs and genes for TLB and GLS will aid in resolving the genetic basis of these two traits and further facilitate genomic-assisted breeding. Based on our results, we argue that Ext-BSA is a robust and cost-efficient method for detecting target genes and loci for complex traits in the context of BSA.
